        '''
        For simulating the pink appearance in a pseudo H&E image using multiplexed imaging like Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC),
        focus on channels that tag proteins predominantly located in the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix.
        These are areas where eosin, which stains acidic components of the cell such as proteins, typically binds in traditional H&E staining.
        Proteins like collagen, which is a major component of the extracellular matrix, and fibronectin, another matrix protein,
        are ideal for this purpose. Additionally, cytoplasmic proteins such as cytokeratins in epithelial cells and muscle actin in muscle tissues would also appear pink,
        reflecting their substantial protein content and eosinophilic properties.

        For achieving a purple hue, the approach involves selecting channels that label proteins found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm,
        or at their interface. It includes markers associated with epithelial cells and other specific dense structures, giving a purple hue due to the density and nature of these proteins.
        This color is typically seen where there is a merging of the blue nuclear staining and the pink cytoplasmic staining.
        Intermediate filament proteins like cytokeratins, which are densely packed in the cytoplasm, and vimentin, common in mesenchymal cells, are key targets.
        Membrane proteins such as Caveolin-1, which is localized to the plasma membrane, can also contribute to this effect.
        These proteins, due to their strategic locations and the properties of the tagged antibodies used,
        allow for a nuanced blending of blue and pink, creating the purple appearance commonly observed in regions of cell-cell interaction or dense cytoplasmic content in traditional H&E staining.

        For highlighting red blood cells with vivid red, choosing the right markers is crucial.
        Ter119 is an ideal choice, as it specifically targets a protein expressed on the surface of erythroid cells in mice, from early progenitors to mature erythrocytes.
        This marker, when conjugated with a metal isotope, allows for precise visualization of red blood cells within tissue sections.
        To simulate the red appearance typical of eosin staining in traditional histology,
        Ter119 can be assigned a bright red color in the image analysis software.
        Additionally, targeting hemoglobin with a specific antibody can also serve as an alternative or complementary approach,
        as hemoglobin is abundant in red blood cells and can be visualized similarly by assigning a red color to its corresponding channel.
        Both strategies ensure that red blood cells stand out distinctly in the IMC data,
        providing a clear contrast to other cellular components and mimicking the traditional histological look.

        Here are some specific examples:

        Markers typically staining the cytoplasm, cytoskeletal elements, or ECM (Pink Eosin):
        Collagen (Col1A1, Col3A1, Col4A1): Collagens are major components of the ECM and appear pink in H&E staining.
        Fibronectin (FN): An ECM glycoprotein that helps in cell adhesion and migration, typically stained pink.
        Vimentin (VIM): An intermediate filament protein found in mesenchymal cells, contributes to the cytoplasmic structure, often stained pink.
        Alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA): Found in smooth muscle cells, it stains the cytoplasm and is often observed in connective tissue.
        CD31 (PECAM-1): Found on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels; staining can reveal the cytoplasmic extensions.
        Desmin: An intermediate filament in muscle cells, contributing to cytoplasmic staining.
        Laminin: A component of the basal lamina (part of the ECM), often appears pink in H&E staining.
        Actin: A cytoskeletal protein found throughout the cytoplasm.
        Fibronectin: Another ECM protein, contributing to the pink staining of connective tissues.

        Markers typically staining epithelial cells and other specific structures (Purple Eosin):
        Pan-cytokeratin (panCK), CK7, CK20: Cytokeratins are intermediate filament proteins in epithelial cells, and their dense networks can give a purple hue.
        Caveolin-1 (CAV1): Involved in caveolae formation in the cell membrane, often in epithelial and endothelial cells.
        Aquaporin-1 (AQP1): A water channel protein found in various epithelial and endothelial cells.
        EpCAM (EPCAM): An epithelial cell adhesion molecule, important in epithelial cell-cell adhesion.
        E-cadherin, P-cadherin: Adhesion molecules in epithelial cells, contributing to cell-cell junctions, often seen in purple.
        Mucin 1 (MUC1): A glycoprotein expressed on the surface of epithelial cells, contributing to the viscous secretions.
        S100: A protein often used to mark nerve cells, melanocytes, and others, contributing to more specific staining often appearing purple.
        SMA (Smooth Muscle Actin): Although sometimes considered under cytoskeletal, it often appears in more dense structures giving a purple hue.

        Markers specific to red blood cells:
        Ter119: A marker specific to erythroid cells (red blood cells).
        CD235a (Glycophorin A): Another marker specific to erythrocytes.
